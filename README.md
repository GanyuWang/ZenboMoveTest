# ZenboMoveTest

This project is a simple android demo which shows how to use Zenbo SDK. (You can find the APP in one of our lab's robot called "ZenboMoveTest".)

All of the necessary documents and components for Zenbo can be found in https://zenbo.asus.com/developer/. 
You should first add the Zenbo SDK in your project's library. 

The most useful file of this project is \app\src\main\java\com\example\wgy\zenbomovetest\MainActivity.java. 
It shows how to instantiate a controller for Zenbo. Other functions can be implemented in a similar way by referring the online document https://zenbo.asus.com/developer/documents/Zenbo-SDK/DialogSystem.
